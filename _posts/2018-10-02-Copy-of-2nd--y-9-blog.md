    <td>Today we did not do much first we solved the cipher  but then we all logged on and had a spreadsheet up and created our own ciphers which were useful and made decoding units for them as well which made the user interface better we then created a more user friendly interface with instructions we then added a decoded and a randomiser which made the cipher more encrypted </td>
